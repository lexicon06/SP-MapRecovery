# SP-MapRecovery

## Description
The **SP-MapRecovery** plugin is designed to recover the latest map when the server crashes or is restarted. This plugin was created specifically for my own Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2) server, so it may not work for everyone.

## Features
- Recovers the last played map after a server crash or restart.
- Automatically updates the recovery file with the current map name.
- Simple and efficient implementation.

## Installation
1. Download the plugin files.
2. Place the files in the appropriate directories on your server.
3. Ensure the `map_recover.txt` file is located in the `configs` directory. (or don't, it will be created anyway)

## Usage
The plugin will automatically handle map recovery when the server starts. No additional configuration is required.

## ConVars
- `sm_maprecovery_version`: Displays the version of the Map Recovery Plugin.
